Gradient Tools Grasshopper plugin for Rhino 7

I started this plugin to build a set of tools to help me with my daily work. I will share this plugin on food4rhino on if it grows to have more tools. Till then, to install it copy the following file

[GradientTools.gha](GradientTools/GradientTools.gha)

At the paste it at the following location

```C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries```

If you build the [project](GradientTools) locally using Visual Studio, the .gha file will be copied to the above location
automatically.
